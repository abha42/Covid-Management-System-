                    <h3>Wash Your Hands</h3>
                    <p>Respiratory viruses like coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread when mucus or 
droplets containing the virus get into your body through your eyes, nose or throat. Most often, this 
happens through your hands.During a global pandemic, one of the cheapest, easiest, and most important 
ways to prevent the spread of a virus is to wash your hands frequently with soap and water.To eliminate 
all traces of the virus on your hands, a quick scrub and a rinse won’t cut it. Below is a step-by-step 
process for effective handwashing - <br>
Step 1: Wet hands with running water.<br>
Step 2: Apply enough soap to cover wet hands.<br>
Step 3: Scrub all surfaces of the hands including back of hands, between fingers and under nails for at 
least 20 seconds.<br>
Step 4: Rinse thoroughly with running water.<br>
Step 5: Dry hands with a clean cloth or single-use towel<br>You should wash your hands for at least 20-30 
seconds. The same goes for hand sanitizer. Use a sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol and rub it
into your hands for at least 20 seconds to ensure full coverage.You should make sure to wash your hands
after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, after visiting a public space, including public 
transportation, markets and places of worship, after touching surfaces outside of the home, including 
money, before, during and after caring for a sick person, before and after eating.</p>

                    <h3>Always Wear A Mask</h3>
                    <p>Face masks combined with other preventive measures can help slow the spread of the 
virus that causes COVID-19. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends wearing a
mask indoors in public and outdoors in crowded areas or when you are in close contact with unvaccinated 
people. The effectiveness of masks can be improved by ensuring that the masks are well fitted to the 
contours of your face to prevent leakage of air around the masks' edges. Masks should be snug over the 
nose, mouth and chin, with no gaps. You should feel warm air coming through the front of the mask when you
breathe out. You shouldn't feel air coming out under the edges of the mask. Choose masks that have 
bendable nose strips, as these help prevent air from leaking out of the top of the mask. Masks with 
several layers offer more protection. Proper use, storage and cleaning of masks also affects how well they
protect you. Follow these steps for putting on and taking off your mask :<br>
1) Wash or sanitize your hands before and after putting on your mask.<br>
2) Place your mask over your mouth and nose and chin.<br>
3) Tie it behind your head or use ear loops. Make sure it's snug against your face.<br>
4) Don't touch your mask while wearing it.<br>
5) If you accidentally touch your mask, wash or sanitize your hands.<br>
6) If your mask becomes wet or dirty, switch to a clean one. Put the used mask in a sealable bag until you
can get rid of it or wash it.<br>
7) Remove the mask by untying it or lifting off the ear loops without touching the front of the mask or 
your face. Fold the outside corners together.<br>
8) Wash your hands immediately after removing your mask.<br> 
9) Regularly wash cloth masks in the washing machine or by hand. (They can be washed along with other 
laundry.) Dry them in the dryer or hang them outside in the sun.<br>
10) Throw away disposable masks after wearing them once.<br>
And don't forget these precautions:<br>
1) Don't put masks on anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious or otherwise unable to remove the
 mask without help.<br>
2) Don't put masks on children under age 2.<br>
3) Don't use face masks as a substitute for physical distancing.<br>

                    <h3>Stay Home</h3>
                    <p>The reason why you’re asked to stay home is to: <br>
1) Prevent you from catching the virus from others who may have it.<br>
2) Prevent you from spreading the virus to others in case you may have it.<br>
3) Allow all the medical personnel to deal with all the patients they currently have.<br>
4) Prevent the number of positive infected to increase to the point where hospitals are unable to cope and
will have to be selective of who they treat — meaning, there will be those who will be left to die.<br>
5) Allow your body to build its own immune system towards the virus — this is especially for those who may
have it but are not showing signs and may not develop any symptoms.<br>
The thing is, the virus — although not airborne — is very lethal. If you have it and you sneeze or cough,
 it produces over 3,000 droplets that will either go straight into someone else (through the eyes, nose, 
 mouth, etc) or land on a surface and depending on the type of surface (be it metal, plastic, hot, cold, 
 etc) can survive anywhere between a few hours to a few days. That gives it time to potentially get onto 
 other people through contact.If you’re not out there, you lower the chances of that happening.The 
 COVID-19 virus is apparently 3–5 times more infectious than a normal flu virus. Staying at home also 
 allows those who may be infected (but do not know) to either let their bodies build up their immune 
 system to fight the virus naturally or to develop the symptoms without infecting others and allowing the
  now confirmed patient to seek the treatment that they need.</p>

                    <h3>Avoid Crowded Area</h3>
                    <p> COVID-19 is primarily spread from person-to-person via the respiratory droplets 
released when an infected person coughs, speaks or even breathes. Social distancing aims to prevent this 
spread by reducing close contact between people. The CDC reports that someone infected with COVID-19 can 
be contagious before symptoms ever even begin. To make matters worse, some people remain completely 
asymptomatic, but are still contagious. Preventive measures like social distancing help protect vulnerable
 people from developing more serious illness. Social distancing can include large-scale measures, like 
 canceling crowded group events and closing public spaces. But it also includes a conscious, individual 
 effort from each one us to practice the measures that help prevent the spread of COVID-19. One of the 
 primary benefits of social distancing, if put into action early enough during an outbreak, is the effect
  it has on the "epidemic curve" — namely, its ability to flatten it. Someone with COVID-19 can
  potentially infect up to 3 different people at the same time. If one of the first 3 people that got 
  infected stayed home after that and not go out, the number of spread would not be that big. Over time,
   the spread will lessen and the curve will be flattened. </p>
