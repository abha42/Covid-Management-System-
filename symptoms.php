                <h3>Dry Cough</h3>
                <p>A common symptom of COVID-19 is a dry cough, which is also known as an unproductive 
cough (a cough that doesn’t produce any phlegm or mucus). A person with a dry cough may experience a dry, 
scratchy, sore, or rough throat. There may also be a sensation of a tickle in the throat or a patch of the
throat that feels dry, even when swallowing. There may not be any relief from a dry cough, even after 
coughing. A dry cough caused by COVID-19 is typically deep and low, occurring at the bottom of the lungs.
A dry cough is a common early symptom of COVID-19. According to some estimates, 60–70% of people who 
develop COVID-19 symptoms experience a dry cough as an initial symptom. Ways to help a dry cough - <br>
1) Keep yourself well hydrated by drinking small amounts often throughout the day. <br>
2) Soothe your throat by drinking a warm drink, such as honey and lemon.<br>
3) Take small sips of liquid if you feel yourself starting to cough. <br>
4) Suck a sugary sweet if you feel yourself starting to cough.<br>
5) Try swallowing repeatedly if you have a cough and don't have a drink near you.<br>
6) Blow your nose if you have a runny nose – try not to sniff.<br>
You can also use positions to ease breathing if you cough when you go to bed.
Avoid things that make you cough. For example: smoking, smoky atmospheres, air fresheners, strong smelling
candles, strong perfumes or deodorants</p>

                <h3>Sore Throat</h3>
                <p>A sore throat is one of the many potential symptoms of COVID-19, which is the 
respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. According to the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC), the symptoms that develop with COVID-19 can vary from one person to another.
A survey study published in February 2021 notes that, compared with other symptoms, a sore throat had an 
earlier onset. Respiratory viruses are inhaled, meaning they enter your nose and throat first. They may 
replicate there early on, leading to throat soreness and irritation. Reports on how common a sore throat 
is with COVID-19 varies based on the group that’s being studied. For example, a study of 120 people with 
COVID-19 found that a sore throat was reported by 30 percent of study participants. Another study of 99 
people found that it was only reported in 5 percent of cases. A study in China, commissioned by the World
Health Organization (WHO) and published early in the pandemic, found that out of more than 55,000 
confirmed cases, only 13.9 percent of people reported a sore throat. This aligns with the findings of a 
systematic review and meta-analysis that was published in November 2020. Researchers analyzed 148 studies
that looked at the symptoms in 24,410 adults with confirmed COVID-19. It found that the prevalence of a 
sore throat was 12 percent. The ZOE Study, an initiative started by the ZOE Company and King’s College 
London, tracks self-reported COVID-19 symptoms through the COVID-19 Symptom Study app (iOS, Android). So 
far, a sore throat is a commonly reported symptom, with almost half of users reporting it. This symptom is
also more often reported in people between the ages of 18 and 65, and appears to be slightly less common 
in vaccinated people. Age may also be a factor in the type of COVID-19 symptoms you have.An observational
study published in January 2021 involved 373 healthcare workers. Of those who got COVID-19, typical cold 
symptoms like sore throat and runny or stuffy nose were more commonly reported in participants under the 
age of 30.</p>

                <h3>Running Nose</h3>
                <p>A runny nose can be a symptom of COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) note that a runny nose can be a symptom of COVID-19 in both children and adults.
There are multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2. According to the Washington State Department of Health, 
a runny nose is rarely a symptom of COVID-19 that is due to previous variants of the virus, but it can 
occur.However, according to recent evidence, a runny nose may be a main symptom of COVID-19 that results 
from the recently discovered delta variant. The delta variant accounted for 10% of COVID-19 cases in the 
United States as of June 14, 2021. Recent data from the United Kingdom Zoe COVID Symptom study suggest 
that delta variant infections manifest with a headache, followed by a sore throat, a runny nose, and a 
fever. For this reason, anyone with a runny nose should consider getting a COVID-19 test.</p>

                <h3>Fever</h3>
                <p>Fever is a common symptom of COVID-19, but it remains unclear exactly how common. A 
2020 review in PLOS One with data from almost 25,000 adults found that fever was the most common symptom.
It was present in 78% of cases.A study in China found that only 44% of people who stayed in the hospital 
for COVID-19 had fever upon admission. However, just under 89 % experienced fever at some point during the
hospitalization. Fever appears to be one of the most common COVID-19 symptoms, but people with this 
disease do not always experience fever, and some people develop no symptoms at all.The COVID Symptom Study
app found that around four in ten people reporting symptoms of COVID-19 have a high temperature (fever).
Fever is not necessarily a bad thing. It’s a normal response to infection, as raising your body 
temperature helps your immune system fight it off. If you’re under 65, having a temperature over 37.8°C 
is likely to be a sign of COVID-19. If you’re over 65 or very thin, your normal body temperature is likely
to be lower, so a reading over 37.4°C should be considered to be a potential symptom. Fever usually 
happens in the first week of illness and tends to go quite quickly. However, some people with long-lasting 
symptoms (long COVID) have reported having recurring fever/chills. Fever is a reasonably common symptom of
COVID-19, affecting an average of four in ten (40%) of children and adults at some point in their illness.
Importantly, this means that most people (60%) with COVID-19 will not have a fever, even though it is 
considered to be one of the three ‘classic’ symptoms of the disease, along with persistent coughing and 
loss of smell (anosmia).</p>

                <h3>Headache</h3>
                <p>Although not mentioned as much, headaches can also be early symptoms of COVID-19 for 
all age groups, with headaches being less common in children. Data and research continue to determine why 
headaches are a cause of COVID, but like any other respiratory infection, the link between headaches and 
COVID is not that uncommon. Some medical specialists suggest that another theory may be that fluid enters 
around the brain, possibly triggering a headache in COVID patients. In addition, dehydration or hunger as 
a result of eating and drinking habits changing while dealing with COVID can be culprits. Persistent 
headaches also appear to occur in those who have previously had COVID, also known as post-COVID headaches.
A COVID headache, particularly during what is known as the initial phase of the infection, can trigger 
what feels like a migraine or tension headache. The pain can range from moderate to severe.A COVID 
headache can take place in various locations, depending on the person and case. As mentioned earlier, a 
COVID headache can sometimes be similar to a migraine, the discomfort could be unilateral in the head with
throbbing and a sensitivity to sound or light. The discomfort and pain of the headache can also take place
bilaterally across both sides of the head. Suggested medications for your headache pain include 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, acetaminophen, aspirin, naproxen, or 
paracetamol. Most importantly, seeking urgent medical care and attention is recommended, especially if 
you are also having breathing issues, feelings of confusion, and other symptoms with your headaches. If 
the headaches worsen and persist, do not hesitate to get yourself tested for COVID-19.</p>

                <h3>Vomiting</h3>
                <p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), many people with 
COVID-19 experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea — sometimes even 
before developing the respiratory tract symptoms. Vomiting and other gastrointestinal issue were the only
sign of a COVID-19 infection, or a precursor to the infection. According to research published in The 
American Journal of Gastroenterology in April, more than 50% of 204 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in 
China's Hubei province between January 18 and February 28 reported digestive symptoms like lack of 
appetite, diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. Six of those patients had no respiratory symptoms 
whatsoever. Research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, too, identified 14 
coronavirus patients who had diarrhea and nausea before they showed any signs of fever or respiratory 
symptoms — that was equal to about 10% of the study's 138-person sample size. While experts aren't 
entirely sure why or how COVID-19 may cause vomiting or other gastrointestinal symptoms, researchers have 
a theory : Because the molecule that the coronavirus attacks in the body—angiotensin-converting enzyme 2,
or ACE2—exists not only in the lungs, but in the gastrointestinal tract as well, that may explain why some
people experience stomach issues. Another study published The American Journal of Gastroenterology 
suggests that the virus can enter the digestive system through cell surface receptors for ACE2. Receptors 
for this enzyme are 100 times more common in the gastrointestinal tract than the respiratory tract. Still,
 more research needs to be done to identify the exact mechanism. </p>
